# Team-Player


GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated



```bash
node index.js
```

It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

```md
.
├── __tests__/             //jest tests
│   ├── Employee.test.js
│   ├── Engineer.test.js
│   ├── Intern.test.js
│   └── Manager.test.js
├── dist/                  // rendered output (HTML) and CSS style sheet      
├── lib/                   // classes
├── src/                   // template helper code 
├── .gitignore             // indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
├── index.js               // runs the application
└── package.json           
```




**Important**: Make sure that you remove `dist` from the `.gitignore` file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.

The application must include `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) must ALL pass.

The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and methods:

* `name`

* `id`

* `email`

* `getName()`

* `getId()`

* `getEmail()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;returns `'Employee'`

The other three classes will extend `Employee`.

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have the following:

* `officeNumber`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Manager'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have the following:

* `github`&mdash;GitHub username

* `getGithub()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Engineer'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have the following:

* `school`

* `getSchool()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Intern'`

Finally, although it’s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.

## Grading Requirements

This homework is graded based on the following criteria:

### Deliverables: 15%

* A sample HTML file generated using the application must be submitted.

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

### Walkthrough Video: 32%

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the Team Profile Generator and passing tests must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

* The walkthrough video must show all four tests passing from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated HTML file that matches the user input.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

  * Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

  * Uses the [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for a suite of unit tests.

  * The application must have `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes.

### Repository Quality: 13%

* Repository has a unique name.

* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
